## Rates

I work with a set of two hourly rates:

### &euro; 80,- per hour
If you like to hire me for a fixed price; this is the hourly rate we're discussing. The reason for this is simple: as a developer, I'm supposed to give you a quote on something that we haven't build yet. While chances are that -during the process- we run into issues we didn't anticipate before. This meaning that the project is still inside the original scope, just with an extra challenge. 
With this hourly rate you can be certain that I will finish the job nonetheless and I won't charge you extra for the work.

Consultency and team training also fall under this rate. 

<br/>

### &euro; 65,- per hour
This is my regular hourly rate. Obviously, before we start a project together, I will give you a quote and in it I will tell you how many hours I think I need for the project. If the project goes well and I end up needing less hours; great! I won't charge you for more. If it ends up being more than the originally quoted amount I will tell you before-hand and we can decide together wether work should continue.

## Billing

I bill dependent on the project. If your project spans multiple months, I will send you a bill for the work done each month. If it's a smaller project I require a downpayment of 50% upfront. After technical delivery I will bill another 40% and the last 10% will either be billed when the project goes live or one month after delivery; whichever comes first.

Each bill will have a detailed time sheet of the work that has been done.

## Content & source material

You, the client, are responsible for delivering any of the needed source-files, images and text for the project in a timely manner.


---

## Browser support

Any of the websites created by me will have support for the following browsers: Internet Explorer 10 and up (including each version of Edge), the latest two versions of Chrome and Firefox, Safari 4 (and up), Chrome on Android KitKat (and up), Safari on iOS6 (and up). Fixes for newer browsers after the release of the project will be billed with the regular hourly rate.

## Third party costs

Possible other costs for non-resellable materials like fonts and photo licenses aren't included in my quotes. They'll be added to the eventual invoice and of course I shall first consult with you, the client, to check if buying a third party material is okay.


---

## Third party services

I don't deliver garantees on the use of any third-party API. I have no control over what companies like Facebook or Twitter decide to do with their API's. Any work that needs to happen on a project dependent on an external API will be billed with the regular hourly rate.
