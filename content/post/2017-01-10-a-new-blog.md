So here we go; a new blog on a new domain. I'm trying to write more this year, so a personal blog felt like a proper solution. There is, however, a big difference in how I created this blog compared to my previous personal sites. It's running on [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) instead of WordPress.

## Jekyll
I've been using Jekyll to generate static pages for documentation for about two years now and ever since then I've loved it. It loads super-quick, markdown writes really easily and you do not accidentally publish a post (since you would have to commit it using GIT).

I still have to dive deeper into theming for Jekyll though. Right now I'm running an of-the-rack theme ([it's the Hyde theme, in case you're wondering](https://github.com/poole/hyde)) with a few css changes (I changed the fonts and obviously the background using some css variables) which is fine for now, but I always like to keep tweaking my site, so eventually I will replace it.
