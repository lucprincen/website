The past few days have been filled with a lot of friends, laughs, talks, ideas and yeah, a lot of beers as well. WordCamp Europe 2017 in Paris was a blast, but it's not over for me until [I blog](https://www.chefduweb.nl/2013/10/wordcamp-europe-2013/) [about it](https://www.chefduweb.nl/2016/07/wordcamp-europe-2016/) (although I forgot to blog about WordCamp Europe 2014). So here goes... after last year it seems appropriate to, once again, start with a yawning selfie of me getting up way to early for the trip:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Good morning <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/wceu?src=hash">#wceu</a>... see you in a bit. <a href="https://t.co/pTrIARbdyW">pic.twitter.com/pTrIARbdyW</a></p>&mdash; Luc Princen (@LucP) <a href="https://twitter.com/LucP/status/875200850150514690">June 15, 2017</a></blockquote>

About [a week before WCEU I announced that I was going freelance for a while](/time-for-something-new/), so this was the first WordCamp Europe I've attended as an independent. This meant talking to a whole lot of people which made this possibly the most social conference I've ever been at. Although WordCamp Nederland last October was a very hard one to beat, in the social sense.

<br/>

## The talks

Due to the socializing, I didn't get to see that many talks. However; the ones I saw where very informative! There's definitely been another bump in quality compared to previous WordCamps.

### The three kinds of design - John Maeda
John Maeda is kind of a legend in the (digital) design world, so going here was -for me at least- a personal requirement. 

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Also: <a href="https://twitter.com/johnmaeda">@johnmaeda</a> is proving you don&#39;t need slides. Presenting from an open pdf in preview üò¨üçæ</p>&mdash; Luc Princen (@LucP) <a href="https://twitter.com/LucP/status/875646728518512644">June 16, 2017</a></blockquote>

Armed with a nice looking PDF opened in MacOs' preview app, John started talking about what it means to do -what he called- computed design. An interesting specification that, by his own words, not a lot of designers understand yet. The big shift that is needed in our thinking is, acording to John, because we've never had to design anything with a shape-shifting canvas before. Now, with all the various screensizes, cultures, devices and types of connections, doing design requires a lot more know-how. 

I loved the fact that he looked beyond the technical part of digital design and focussed his talk heavily on different cultures and different connection-types (celular, 4G, etc. )


### Security is a Process - Mark Jaquith
It's always smart to hear what Mark has to say. Although I was aware of a lot of the specific tools available in WordPress, the main message was a good kind of gut punch. Security isn't a destination. It's not an endpoint; it's a constantly evolving process. It also requires a black state of mind to get into this process.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">the talk from <a href="https://twitter.com/markjaquith">@markjaquith</a> has a nice vibe going about trust. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/WCEU?src=hash">#WCEU</a> <a href="https://t.co/bSxTfVzpOS">pic.twitter.com/bSxTfVzpOS</a></p>&mdash; Maik Gruppen (@maikgruppen) <a href="https://twitter.com/maikgruppen/status/875661200469745664">June 16, 2017</a></blockquote>

I've learned that I still need to be able to turn this non-trusting mind on or off. No idea how yet, but we'll get there :)


### CSS Grid Changes Everything - Morten Rand-Hendriksen
I submitted a talk this WordCamp about CSS Grid. It wasn't selected in favor of this talk. I should be bitter, but I can't overstate how happy I was I got bumped in favor of Morten. He's a very talented speaker and explained CSS Grid in a fantastic way. Like audible-gasps-from-the-audience good. Best talk I saw this WordCamp, if I'm totally honest. I'm glad I ignored the hangover I had from the night before and was at the venue at 9am.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Me and my big mouth were telling everybody that &quot;Css Grid was going to be big&quot;. Ugh, and now I have to get out of bed üòë. Thanks <a href="https://twitter.com/mor10">@mor10</a> üòíüòò</p>&mdash; Luc Princen (@LucP) <a href="https://twitter.com/LucP/status/875952243580825600">June 17, 2017</a></blockquote>

### Accessibility In The Age Of The Headless CMS - Rian Rietveld
Accessibility is important. And it's on the agenda at conferences like wceu in large part because of Rian. You can't blame the organizers for inviting her again for a talk. And why should you? Because Rian showed us a very interestign -and utterly overshadowed- part of accesibility: Accessibility in combination with single-page web apps. Something WordPress has been inching towards the past couple of years. 

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">&quot;I signed a code of conduct, so i cannot swear here, but for crying out loud&quot; <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/WCEU?src=hash">#WCEU</a> <a href="https://t.co/utVeTNsgKl">pic.twitter.com/utVeTNsgKl</a></p>&mdash; Luc Princen (@LucP) <a href="https://twitter.com/LucP/status/876004930137583616">June 17, 2017</a></blockquote>

I learned a ton of new stuff from this talk (like the [aria-live](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/ARIA_Live_Regions) attribute) but the main take-away was that learning fancy new tools like React might be cool for a developer, but first we need to get the basics right. So much of accessibility in single-page-app land is still going wrong by just using the wrong mark-up.

<br/>

## Conversations & People

I had a lot of great conversations, so talking about all of them would be impossible. I just want to highlight a few. On the second day of the conference I had a great talk with [Omar](https://twitter.com/OmarReiss) and [Anton](https://twitter.com/atimmer10) from [Yoast](https://yoast.com) about a document- versus application-approach to development. It cleared a lot up for me (like the appeal for inline styling in React, which got the ball rolling conversation-wise). Had a cool discussion with [Ramon](https://twitter.com/ramonfincken) of Managed WP, and I also liked talking to [Jean and Alyona Galea from WP Mayor](https://www.wpmayor.com/) during the after-party.

Speaking of party; I love hanging out with the fine-ass people of [Level-level](https://level-level.com/) again and I hope they never lose that [010-swagger](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fu297WeLMKc). 

I was utterly humbled by discussions with [Joost](https://twitter.com/jdevalk), [Marieke](https://twitter.com/MariekeRakt) and [Michiel](https://twitter.com/michielheijmans) of Yoast, [Rosanne](https://twitter.com/BuroStaal) of Buro Staal and [Saskia](https://twitter.com/saskiageleedts). Thank you for your kind words. Also thanks to [Marcel](https://twitter.com/mbootsman) for some good advice ;-)

## Parties

After that cascade of links, I just have to talk about the parties, because party-wise I think this was the best WordCamp Europe yet. On the first conference day, at about 4pm, a guy came up to us and told us about a pop-up bar the guys from [Dekode](https://dekode.no/) had arranged. We had some nice beers and talked to some interesting people. It was exectly the pick-me-up I needed after a long (and hot) day of talks.

The second party I went to in Paris was later that night and held by [Savvii](https://www.savvii.nl/) and was aptly named "WordPint". On the foot of the Sacre-Coeur, we enjoyed the view, the good company and a lot of nice beers. Apart from the occasional french jogger, the party was fantastic! Although we did [mis out on a proposal](https://twitter.com/michielheijmans/status/875785068480004097) over at the Go-Daddy party in the Paris Aquarium :)

Then there was the after-party organised by the event itself. The location was beautiful and the drinks were reasonably priced (for Paris). There was a lot of post-WordCamp stress unloading on the dance-floor :)

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">P. A. R. T. Y<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/WCEU?src=hash">#WCEU</a> <a href="https://t.co/oA9BpaR3dH">pic.twitter.com/oA9BpaR3dH</a></p>&mdash; Marcel Bootsman (@mbootsman) <a href="https://twitter.com/mbootsman/status/876198592461123586">June 17, 2017</a></blockquote>

The only down-side (of the entire event, actually) was the food-situation at the party. But there has been a lot of discussion about that already, so no need to bring it up again.

<br/>

## Up next

In 2018 we'll be having a ball in Belgrade! Servia's capital was chosen as the official next host-city. I can't wait for next year, because I've never been there and really love eastern europe and it's cities, people and cultures. And [also because of this](https://twitter.com/Mamaduka/status/876708216146726913).

Until next year! ;-)
