So as you might have read in [a previous blog post]({{site.baseUrl}}/2017/06/07/time-for-something-new.html), my son needs some extra attention in the medical department. He has a form of autism (which form we're not completely sure on) which is currently grinding his early development as a human being to a halt. He's about 4,5 years old but doesn't talk (not even words like daddy or mommy). And apart from the autism there's another factor at play, which is what I wanted to talk about today.

## 18q Deletion
The factor at play is an 18q deletion. A fairly recently discovered syndrome where a piece of the long arm of the 18th chromosome is missing. In case you didn't know (I sure didn't when we started this because I used to thing biology was boring); a chromosome is a twirled up bunch of DNA double helixes crammed into a string-like shape. Think of a chromosome as the string and the DNA as the threads making up the string. 

This mutation is pretty rare (only one in 40.000 kids get it) which means there's about two cases each year in The Netherlands. It can be heriditary but in the case of our son it's a mutation started at conception; it's not a thing he inherited from me or his mom. 

So my kid literally has a merge-error in his DNA. The problem with DNA is that we do not really know how to fix this merge-error since it's in every cell of his body. The astounding thing (to me) is the fact that we do know what is in this bit of DNA and what symptoms are associated with it.
