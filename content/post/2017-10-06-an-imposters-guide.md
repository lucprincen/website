I have a secret: I've never considered myself a real developer. Even though I work in code every day. Eventhough I know design-patterns, version control, inheritence and OOP. 


## A little history.
I don't have a computer science degree and had very little programming in college. I studied to be a digital designer. I know typography, color theory and took plenty of classes in Interface- and user-centered design.

Eventhough I've done a bit of development prior to college and did a lot of development-work during my internship, I really just started learning the basics after I graduated.
