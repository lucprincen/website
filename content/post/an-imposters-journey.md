Let me confess something to you: I've never felt as a real developer. 
I never took a computer science class, and I did very little programming in college. As a matter of fact; most of my time spend in college was on Design. 

After college, however, I started to freelance as a developer as well. I had little experience, but that didn't matter. Within no-time most of my billable hours where coming from development gigs. 

## TLDR;
This blogpost is an adaptation of a talk I did at WordCamp Utrecht in November of 2017. If you don't fancy reading the damn thing, you can watch the video here:
