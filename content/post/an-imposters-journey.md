## TLDR;
This blogpost is an adaptation of a talk I did at WordCamp Utrecht in November of 2017. If you don't fancy reading the damn thing, [you can watch the video here](https://wordpress.tv/2018/01/04/luc-princen-an-imposters-journey-through-real-development/).

## A confession

Let me confess something to you: I've never felt as a real developer. 
I never took a computer science class, and I did very little programming in college. As a matter of fact; most of my time spend in college was on Design. 

I did do some development at an early age though. The first program I ever wrote was in basic:

{{< highlight basic >}}
10 print "peanuts"
20 goto 10
{{< /highlight >}}
<small class="caption">* Peanuts wasn't the actual word I printed. I was about 8, so it was much more juveline, but phonettically pretty close.</small>

After college, however, I started to freelance as a developer as well. I had little experience, but that didn't matter. Within no-time most of my billable hours where coming from development gigs.

## The Imposter Syndrome: some theory

In the late 70s, Docter Pauline Clance first published a paper on what she would call the imposter phenomenon. In it, she described this vicious cycle about how seemingly regular work could eventually make you feel like a worthless bag of dirt.

There's a huge group of people that will recognise something in this cycle. In fact, [according to the journal of behavioural science, about 70% of millennials experience some form of the imposter syndrome](https://thehustle.co/why-70-percent-of-millennials-have-impostor-syndrome)
