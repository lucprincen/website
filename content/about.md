<p class="message">

Hi There! My name is Luc Princen, I live in the Netherlands with my wife and son. I like creating stuff for the web &amp; solving problems. 
</p>

<img src="/images/luc.jpg" class="align-right" alt="This is me.">

I'm a co-founder of online agency [Chef du Web](https://chefduweb.nl) (for which [i recently stopped working](/time-for-something-new/)) and [Alpackit](https://alpack.it). You can find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/LucP)

I work a lot with WordPress and I love open source in general. I'm mostly involved in frontend development where I like elegant code and fast load times.

In my private time I like barbecueing low & slow caveman meals, painting and playing the occasional grand strategy game like Civilization or Europa Universalis.

## Work

I'm an experienced developer and designer. I have worked on big and small projects in big and small teams. I love writing documented and maintainable code. I'm [available for hire](/hire-me/) as a freelancer.
