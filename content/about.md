Hi There! My name is Luc, I live in the Netherlands with my wife and son. I like creating stuff for the web.

</p>

I'm a co-founder of online agency [Chef du Web](https://chefduweb.nl) (for which [i recently stopped working](/time-for-something-new/)) and [Alpackit](https://alpack.it). You can find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/LucP)

I work a lot with WordPress and I love open source in general. I'm mostly involved in frontend development where I like elegant code and fast load times.

In my private time I like barbecueing low & slow caveman meals, painting and playing the occasional grand strategy game like Civilization or Europa Universalis.

## Alpackit

Premium WordPress plugins have a problem; how to easily keep your plugins updated for the regular WordPress user. Creating this system yourself, along with license checks and payment handeling can be a very time consuming task. This is where Alpackit comes in; It allows you to easily sell your licenses and distribute your plugin to anyone who's license is still valid. All you have to know is how to push a commit to your favorite hosted GIT server and we'll take care of the rest
